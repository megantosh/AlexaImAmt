\chapter{Skill Implementation}%: \inote{Kosten-/Terminabfrage}}
\label{maintwo}

In this chapter we present our implementation and hands-on experience throughout.
The code is available on Github (see Chapter \ref{introduction}) with plans for development beyond this thesis. A copy is attached to this work, but cannot fully operate as a standalone software. The runtime environment is offered through the Alexa Skills kit %\inote{github, the new amazon account? ...}
There are many ways to perform setup, several languages we can use to programme 
our Skill and throughout the development process some of these steps were changed. We present the most recent interfaces and implementation possibility using Node.js hosted on AWS Lambda %, However, this is very likely to change in a near future.

\section{Setup}


%\todo{codechunks different labeling??
%}

\subsection*{Minimum Requirements}
For the environment setup, the following tools and credentials are necessary:

\subsubsection*{Amazon Account}
We use it in conjunction with AWS and the Alexa Developer Console. Any account previously created for the Amazon store is usable \footnote{e.g. from here  \url{https://aws.amazon.com/de/resources/create-account/}} as well as to test our skill. Once the account is activated on the developer console, the Skills in development become automatically reachable on any Alexa-enabled device linked to the same account (as an end-user).
	
\subsubsection*{Command Line Tools}
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Python 3} or\textbf{ Ruby 4} need to be installed as a foundation for ASK CLI and AWS CLI.\\
\item  A package manager such as Pip Installs Packages (\textbf{PIP}) for Python or \textbf{RubyGems} for Ruby.\\
\item  Depending on OS, further packages and package managers might need to be installed. (e.g. for macOS: Command-Line Tools for Xcode, Homebrew, easyinstall). These will be prompted throughout the installation process.
%\inote{brew, easyinstall python / win}

\end{itemize}

	
\subsubsection*{API} 
As introduced in Section \ref{Solr}, Our endpoint is a Solr Server that provides us with JSON responses to the queries we do through a RESTful interface from within the Lambda function (hosting back-end code) \footnote{reachable at the time of development on:\url{https://newsreel-edu.aot.tu-berlin.de/solr}}. Since the API endpoint was originally created for the Virtual Citizen Assistant, we need to readjust its output to meet Alexa's requirements.


	
\subsubsection*{Audio} An encoder to create 48kpbs constant bitrate MP3-Format. Audacity \footnote{\url{http://www.audacityteam.org/}} or ffmpeg\footnote{convert by running \lstinline|$ ffmpeg -i <inFile> -ac 2 -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 48k -ar 16000 <outFile.mp3>|} can be used to convert to an Alexa-friendly file format like in the \textsc{ASK Documentation}\footnote{\url{https://developer.amazon.com/de/docs/custom-skills/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference.html\#h3_converting_mp3}}.
	


\subsection*{Managing AWS Credentials}

With the Amazon account we just created (or already have), we will proceed to extend it for developer registration. As we move within the free tier of AWS, no charges were applied. However, a credit card might be required for eventual future billings if the tier limitations were exceeded. We mention pricing schemes in Section \ref{choiceOfPlatform} \footnote{More information on pricing available on: \url{https://aws.amazon.com/de/pricing/}}. Developer registration needs to happen on AWS website\footnote{\url{http://aws.amazon.com}} as well as on the Amazon Developer Portal\footnote{\url{https://developer.amazon.com}} where a some information is required such as company name and business sector. From this point on, anything that manages the back-end of our skill will be associated with AWS Modules, primarily Lambda. Skill configuration and interaction model are hosted on Alexa Skills Kit separately, i.e. managed through the Amazon Developer Console. During the development process, Alexa Skills Kit diverged from the Amazon Developer Console and has become a separate entity called Alexa Console. While still hierarchically belonging to the Amazon Developer Console and reachable from the same domain, except for the developer profile, all skill-related information we need to use are modifiable from within the Alexa Console\footnote{\url{https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit}}

\subsubsection*{Generating Access Keys}~\label{accesskeys}
Linking happens through a private and public key pair - the \textbf{access keys} consisting of a
combination of an \textit{access key ID} (like \lstinline|AK..7EXAMPLE|) and a \textit{secret access key} (e.g \lstinline|{wJalrXUt..I/K7..G/bPx..YEXAMPLEKEY|). We use access keys to sign API requests that you make to AWS.

Creating Access Keys is described in the \textsc{AWS Documentation}\footnote{\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html}}. At this time we interact with the IAM Module from AWS (Identity Access Management), which defines roles of each member in an organisation and partners linked to it, who can gain different levels of access to each module capabilites. Since we are only making basic use of AWS modules and our Lambda instance interacts only with our own API, there is no harm in using 


\subsection*{Initialising The Development Environment}

As minimum package requirements can vary a lot between one OS and another, using a virtual machine is suggested for teams. AWS offers Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) as a service for virtual machines in the cloud. Although this step is mainly for performing command-line prompts later on, if opting for that, it is convenient to avail a web browser inside the virtual machine instance. Otherwise for browser communication the tool we are going to use will generate links that we would need to copy and paste into a browser outside of the virtual machine to link it with the Amazon account we use.


\subsection*{Installing Command-Line Tools}

	$ which node			#check if installed
	$ which npm			 #check if installed
	$ which python		#check if installed

With the JSON we have, we try to maximise its use, but we need to consider that with starting a Skill, it is better to start from scratch sometimes and as we go, we see what is the relevant information that we can integrate into our Skill.

We analyze the output of the \textsc{Virtual Citizen Assistant } and realize it makes less sense to start with that, so we refer to the underlying endpoint. Since this is the Solr Server that delivers JSON objects and is more realistic to maneuver, we analyse the queries we can get from there. and try to fit it into our interaction model.

Then we move on to the interaction model. On paper, we draft the use-cases to determine what are our intents first to group these into fewer intents than the services we have. Given that there are many public services related to a similar case, we design our Skill to make it possible to group them into less intents. The advantage of this is that it allows us to at least have fewer 'ServiceIntents' than the ever growing number of services, which means that we want to also be able to track new services as they get inserted into the catalogue to be able to either map them to old intents by extending these, or to introduce new intents if this does not work.

	We might as well use just our own, any other privately or cloud-based server solution to host our code and use it as an endpoint for our software, however choosing Lambda takes away the overhead of linking the front-end with the back-end of the Skill %program we develop (an Alexa Skill as we describe below).

\section{Code Analysis}

from \url{https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs/blob/master/Readme.md}
The difference between :ask/listen and :tell/speak is that after a :tell/speak action, the session is ended without waiting for the user to provide more input. We will compare the two ways using response or using responseBuilder to create the response object in next section.



A LaunchRequest always starts a new session.

\subsection*{Checking the Next available appointment}

Although this is a proof of concept, with an API extension from ITDZ's side, it is equally easy to implement a feature to look up next available appointments.
The actual booking would require Alexa to send POST requests and persistently retain these on the API's side with the option to impement another feature to save the same appointment to the calendar linked to the Amazon account used with this Alexa instance. This might require account linking, too, if we need to pass the appointment data through the Skill to an online personal calendar endpoint, bypassing Alexa itself.

Booking an appointment happens for now only through Berlin.de's website by starting at either \href{https://service.berlin.de/terminvereinbarung/termin/}{the appointment booking page} \footnote{\url{https://service.berlin.de/terminvereinbarung/termin/}} which links to the actual booking pages via choosing the service or the location where the service

Hey:

do this set up as prerequisites first
as a deployment script

- install aws cli
- install ask cli
- set up a profile on AWS
- ask init etc.
