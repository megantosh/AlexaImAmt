Hey:

do this set up as prerequisites first
as a deployment script

- install aws cli
- install ask cli
- set up a profile on AWS
- ask init etc.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html

There is no AWS credential setup yet, do you want to continue the initialization?

Manage IAM roles (User, groups, rights, policies etc.)


all logs go onto cloudwatch
including when the request is not right etc...can be helpful to know what users want, beyond testing





amazon does not disclose avaliable values for their slot types (lists), but they give you examples here
%https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html#h2_extend_types

finally, we had to resolve to the information publicly available to tailor custom scenarios



 ===
once you upload the new lambda, the old one is gone, unless you version it like this:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/versioning-aliases.html

first i got screwed over with this Big nerd ranch then this happened: alexa-skill module
- so don't use this tutorial, although very helpful for a beginner and makes you understand what happens under the hood, it has been abstracted in many other function and the logic is no longer the same. - which explains why no one starred it
