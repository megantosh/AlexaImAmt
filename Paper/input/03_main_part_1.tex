\chapter{Skill Implementation: \inote{Dienstabfrage}}
\label{mainone}
%DELETEME: In this chapter you start addressing your actual problem. Therefore, it makes often sense to make a detailed problem analysis first (if not done in introduction). You should be sure about what to do and how. As writtin in the background part, it might also make sense to include complex background information or papers you are basing on in this analysis. If you are solving a software problem, you should follow the state of the art of software development which basically includes: problem analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Maintenance is often also described but I believe this will not be required for most theses. Code should be placed in the appendix unless it is solving an essential aspect of your work.

\textcolor{magenta}{Amazon Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text. Powered by the same conversational engine as Alexa, Amazon Lex provides high quality speech recognition and language understanding capabilities, enabling addition of sophisticated, natural language \'chatbots\' to new and existing applications. Amazon Lex reduces multi-platform development effort, allowing you to easily publish your speech or text chatbots to mobile devices and multiple chat services, like Facebook Messenger, Slack, Kik, or Twilio SMS. Native interoperability with AWS Lambda, AWS MobileHub and Amazon CloudWatch and easy integration with many other services on the AWS platform including Amazon Cognito, and Amazon DynamoDB makes bot development effortless.}
