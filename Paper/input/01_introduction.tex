With over a third of the world's population projected to own a smartphone in 2018 \cite{statistasmartphones} and a substantial fraction thereof using smarthome devices on a daily basis, AI's role has become more interesting than ever for productivity and entertainment.
Many technologies we take for granted today, such as dictation and word prediction, recommender systems or other number-based analytics depend on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques that were only made possible thanks to the high computational power shipped in most devices gradually overtaking the consumer market.
This transition also facilitated the introduction of a new form of interaction through conversation with the hardware, paving the way to an aspiration we long strove for \cite{Starwars}.
Conversational bots were already prevalent since the 80s in the form of Question/Answer systems based on query programming languages like PROLOG and SQL.
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA}{ELIZA}, considered as the world's first chatbot and though quite superficial as an NLP-based programme for psychoanalysis, already at its early stages demonstrated how humans can become emotionally attached to machines, transcending over the anomaly of making conversation not with a human \cite{Weizenbaum1976}.
Today, combining ML with the retrieval-based approach allows a more advanced interaction with the system and yields smarter and more personalized chatbots.
Consequently, it is no longer a surprise that chatbots acquire social skills to make \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaoice}{Xiaoice}, the empathetic bot from China, possibly a new kind of friend made of silicon.\\ 

So far, Voice assistants represent an additional layer of abstraction from software beyond the graphical user interface (GUI) and are hence the closest we have come to human communication.
They take away another barrier between the user and the application as they generally do not require profound computer literacy and are modelled to rely on our inherent ways of expression.
As they simulate the human aspect and immitate its behaviour for instance with small-talk abilities\cite{hiddenbrainpod}, voice assistants are regarded as a convenience for daily tasks and are on their way to becoming a de-facto replacement to sophisticated actions we perform on the screen.
In fact, since voice is a primal stimulus in the human brain \cite{voiceneurons}, using it becomes more instinctive, making us in turn process our ideas starting with an ''inner voice'' that translates easiest to words when we speak it before ''funneling'' it into actions \cite{alexapc18}.
Arguably, on a market scale, this gives voice assistants today a competitive innovation advantage (CIA) for they are hence more accessible to further demographic groups with a growing wider acceptance.\\

Further, the speech-to-text/text-to-speech domain has become more powerful with steadily increasing processing power, an effect of Moore's law we only get to understand lately in addition to the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar) \cite{wiki:nlp}.
With an integration in most modern operating systems, speaking to a device has become no longer a absurd novelty. Inadvertently, Google Now, the voice assistant built into the OS currently with the highest usage shares among computer and smartphones \cite{wiki:gartnerreports}, supports understanding of multiple languages in the same sentence for multilingual interaction.
As we constantly challenge our expectations towards technology, a not too far-fetched imagination makes us question the ability of a machine to react to everything we say.
Although we are still far from this step, at least for the consumer level, we dedicate a lot of effort to make it happen with examples like IBM's Watson.
And as long as we still do not exactly understand human intelligence yet, it is hard to fathom AI as a holistic field. As such, it is therefore more realistic to consider the current works in the field as \textit{intelligence amplification} \cite{alexapc18} empowering human take better decisions beyond their normal brain processing power.

\section{Motivation}

%DELETEME: This section is very important since it argues why it is necessary to take care of the problem you are addressing in your work. One way to do this is coming from a very broad view on the problem to a very detailled one. This can be done by establishing a chain of statements that refer to each other until you reach your particular problem. Doing this, you really need to take care for citing every statement.

%DELETEME: Example for a chain: Mobile communication gets increasingly popular in the world (CITE sales on mobile communication infrastruce, mobile phones, or increasing number of mobile phones contracts). $\rightarrow$ Especially smartphones, which represent the next generation cellular phone (CITE), get more and more used for communicating not only with other people but also for connecting to the Internet for using various services (CITE). $\rightarrow$ Smartphone are comprehensive cellular phones that additional functionality due to their increased connection and processing capabilities (CITE). $\rightarrow$ Most smartphones offer an online application store for adding software to the devices which helps the users to customize their devices according to their needs, e.g. Android Market\footnote{\url{http://market.android.com}, visited on 05/08/2011}. $\rightarrow$ One problem about installing third-party software is that not all softwares try to help the user; $\rightarrow$ software with malicious intentions, so called malicious software (malware), can be a severe threat to smarpthone users. Some malwares delete files (EXAMPLE + CITE or footnote with URL) or even destroy devices (EXAMPLE + CITE or footnote with URL). $\rightarrow$ More and more smartphone malwares appeared in the last years (CITE). $\rightarrow$ Signature-based approaches work efficiently on known malware (CITE) but face serious drawbacks regarding unknown malware. $\rightarrow$ Oberheide et al.~\cite{oberheide:2008:cloudav} state that virus engines need an average time of 48 days until their databases get updated to be able to detect a certain unknown malware. $\rightarrow$ This in turn means that smartphone users stay unprotected for this time which can be seen as a severe threat. $\rightarrow$ Therefore, approaches are needed that are capable of detecting unknown malware for protecting the users against such threats.
%DELETEME: This example showed how one could argue that alternative approaches for malware detection is required. The length of the motivation depends on the topics handled and can of course be longer. The principle I am describing is also shown on Figure~\ref{fig:writing}

\inote{poorly written, juxtaopse human to machine etc.}
%- unfortunately forums and FAQ pages are not as effective as talking to a human.\\ 
%- then again, as a customer, if I want assistance, I want the customer to tell me related information that he/she might not know, e.g. model number etc.\\
%- making the bot become something beyond a Q\&A:\\

With the aforementioned, we try to think how voice assistants could come handy and what drives us to consider them instead of available alternatives.
If we consider human workforce (i.e. customer service agents)on one hand, it is commonplace that these are the most expensive, the least available due to restrictive working hours and not always aware of the full circumstances related to an issue they are supposed to fixed or a question they are to answer. \inote{mention a few more associated cons}.
On the other hand, information systems range from web pages (e.g. frequently asked questions section (FAQ), forums). These are in most cases even less effective than contacting a human as getting the proper information takes a lot of time, or the level of trustworthiness particularly in a forum is too low, the problem stated is too broad or too specific compared to the answer we are seeking. A user also usually could come across false positives in a search and rely on irrelevant information without knowing.
furthermore, some case-related information might be required to have a proper understanding of a situation or a scenario and provide adequate answers. For Example, if a user would like to know if a certain accessory is compatible with their mobile device, they might need to give a model number, which they may or may not know.\\

Internationalization is also another factor to take into account.
\todo{continue\\
- internationalization / customization based on Locale
- why is it important?\\
- many international users prefer a chatbot than a phone since the bot will commmunicate more accurately, will not have language probs if it understands the foreign lang etc.\\
- what are other approaches to localization? refer to IRS lecture notes\\
- use of translators, Stammsprache, etc., detecting the language and say it does not support it.\\ 
\\
- for facebook: implementing the three-answer suggestions to help user know what they say or alexa etc
}

It is therefore of high interest to maintain a system that could determine all these factors autonomously or with the least possible human interference such that that system supersedes the abilities of the classical Q\&A approach. We narrow this down with a scenario in the e-Government sector. \\

\subsection{Our Scenario}
\href{https://www.berlin.de}{Berlin.de} is an online one-stop-shop for appx. 3,7 million residents \cite{zensus} with \inote{hundreds/thousands} of visitors daily for information lookup, appointment bookings and even access to local news. As part of a federal modernization procedure with the help of the ministry of interior, D115 was launched in 2009 \cite{d115} as a phone service to help residents find relevant information about a public service or municipality, something that can be tricky if a person has no overview of the local government structure and still not always easy even with the help of search engines nowadays.
\inote{leading sentence}.
Meanwhile, statistics \cite{businsider} show that time spent on messaging apps already surpassed average uptime on social media , which indicates how the former is more desirable as a communication format on mobile platforms. It could therefore be worth exploring, how to offer D115 services in a fashion that takes advantage of conversational abilities beyond its human personnel. 
%To promote information accessibility, D115 continuously aims at expanding its reach and services.\\

For now, although local authorities rely heavily on their websites to communicate information to the public, the challenge is mainly finding the right service. In a metropolis with a high influx of expatriates, it is also very likely that certain services are frequently pursued, meaning that helping find the right public service or authority is a repetitive task. In this context, thinking of a chatbot as a public service could have several advantages, like offloading some traffic from the phone service, getting over the language barrier in the case of non-german speakers or expatriates or simply helping customers forumlate the right wording for a query in a more intuitive way than using a search box. 

% on the other hand more and more people "trust" new technologies and the trends like social media, bots, selfies .. ripple effect - normaization -> results of data collected, what we know about people more than ever before


% like listing required documents for a service, addresses of where the service is offered with opening hours and report on the legal basis of a serv. 

% the language barrier could be even more frustrating. This is where a chatbot could step in, acting as a mediator that can translate natural language into a query for lookup.

%DELETEME: This section does not require eloquent writing. It is just a presentation of what you will handle in each chapter starting with Chapter~\ref{background}.
%


This thesis endeavours to shed light on the following: In Chapter~\ref{background}, we discuss related work as currently available. We first show a few use cases for chat bots and voice assistants and their implementation. For that we consider \inote{the City of Vienna chat bot service \href{https://www.wien.gv.at/bot/}{''WienBot''} for German and Singapore/ \href{http://www.govtech.com/7-State-or-Local-Governments-Using-Amazon-Alexa.html}{LA/...} for English} and compare them to the current application available on \href{https://service.berlin.de/virtueller-assistent/virtueller-assistent-606279.php}{service.berlin.de}.
We then introduce the Alexa platform and the idea behind Skills in chapter~\ref{mainone} and discuss how it can overcome a few struggles with respect to its counterparts \inote{like redundant boilerplate code, smalltalk, but also limitations}. We also present the frameworks we use in our own implementation, the prerequisites and the artefacts provided initially.
Chapter~\ref{mainone} and~\ref{maintwo} represent a detailled analysis of our implementation. In particular, \inote{SOME MORE SENTENCES.
In Chapter~\ref{maintwo}, our solution is presented. This solution covers ... (SOME MORE SENTENCES).}
Chapter~\ref{evaluation} evaluates our implementation with respect to our target in the defined \inote{4-5} use cases. \inote{SOME MORE SENTENCES}
In Chapter~\ref{conclusion}, we conclude with how the implementation of this e-Government solution is attainable through Alexa and where future works can be directed. 
%Chapter~\ref{appendices} gives additional related information on the topic of this thesis.}
