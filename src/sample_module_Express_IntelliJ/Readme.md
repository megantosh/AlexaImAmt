This sample was created by IntelliJ IDEA using Express 4.16
with the purpose only to make the actual module (alexa skill)
show up in the IDE and to have some references for node syntax.  


to show root (Thesis with all subfolders etc)
goto **File > Project Structure > Modules > Add Content Root**
and replace the other directory (at some point known as Prototype2) 
with the AlexaImAmt dir (two levels above).
